ADDED:

- houses sync to server, reload upon login; the following features are missing due to current endpoint constraints (Man said he'll have up and running tomorrow)

1) retaining the public / private status of a listing
2) photo integrity

I'll be able to fix these tomorrow ones the API is working.

- Live search for users in Guestlist
1) Can't add page to actually link them to a house yet because of API constraints. Again, something that Man will address tomorrow.

- UI for My Lockboxes is finished, using static data for the cards (battery level and color, key color, address)
1) Can't hook these up to houses until API constraint is lifted
2) Adding lockbox works dynamically, though. Add >> swipe back a few pages once on the Bluetooth screen >> you'll see new lockbox

- Description page has keyboard-aware scrolling; user can scroll to bottom while keyboard is active
