RELEASE NOTES:

In addition to what's below, I've (seemingly) fixed the major  Navigation issue where app would act weird / crash if a user mashed a navigation button, triggering a fatal series of navigation actions. Please test.

-----

Splash/Login/Create Account/Onboarding/Walkthrough - Complete

** No Jumio verification, just as a reminder

-----

Profile - UI Complete; Functionality works for My Lockboxes / My Homes / Edit Profile

** No Screen in Sketch for Terms of Use

-----

Edit Profile - Complete (still issues w/ server for photos)

-----

My Homes - 90% Complete, including:

1. Real-time updating after adding a house
2. Being able to tap a house, edit, and/or delete

Still to be completed:
1. Functionality of Public / Private. I haven't implemented the "Make House Public" screen yet simply because there's no Sketch screen for it.
2. Server integration

-----

Add House / Edit House - Functionality and UI for all of the following is Complete:

1. Entire photo addition / editing / deleting process
2. General Info
3. Description
4. Instructions
5. Saving

Lockbox: Not sure which screen goes here. Ambiguous in Sketch; will discuss this week.

Make House Public: No Sketch screen for this.

Guestlist: Not started. Will work on UI; functionality must be discussed, though.

*** THINGS TO NOTE: Nothing is integrated with the server since I don't have endpoints for Houses (or Lockboxes) yet. Everything works locally, and will be saved properly until you:

1) Logout
2) Delete the app completely

-----

My Lockboxes:

Can't really work on this until the BLE integration with the actual lockbox is complete. The UI is basic:

- Render button when something happens (successful connection, not found)
- Change to "Lockbox Open / Close" screen after successful connection / straight from "My Lockboxes"

-----

I have many questions, all of which I'll post to Trello.

A major one, of which I'm sure you're aware, is:

Are the Sketch wireframes accurate in depicting the different shades of black for the Navigation header? If so, I'll go ahead and clean that up.
